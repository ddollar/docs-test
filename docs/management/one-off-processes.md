Convox allows you to run two different types of one-off processes. Using `convox run` you can launch a new process and run your command inside that. Using `convox exec` you can run commands against an existing process.

### `convox run`

Spawns a new Process and runs the desired command. You can spawn an interactive shell or run a one-off command.

```
$ convox run web bash
/app #
```

```
$ convox run web bin/migrate
Migrating database... Done
```

### `convox exec`

Attaches to an existing Process and runs the desired command. You can spawn an interactive shell or run a one-off command.

```
$ convox ps
ID            NAME  RELEASE      SIZE  STARTED     COMMAND

5e3c8576b942  web   RSPZQWVWGOP  256   4 days ago  bin/web
```

```
$ convox exec 5e3c8576b942 bash
/app #
```
